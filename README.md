# ESP32 Color/Dice Game

Mini game for ESP32 with a **mode select** screen (Color or Dice), a **single control button**, an **SH1106 (128√ó64) OLED**, an **active buzzer**, and **3 LEDs**.

* **Color Game**: shows 2 boxes on the first row and 1 centered box below with color names.
* **Dice Game**: shows three dice (no boxes) in the same layout.
* **Play control**: short-press to start/stop rolling; **auto-stops after 7s** and shows a full-screen **CONGRATULATIONS** overlay with the **final result**; long-press (‚â•3s) returns to Mode Select.

## üîå Wiring

### ESP32 Pins Used

| Part           | Pin        | Notes                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OLED SDA**   | **GPIO21** | I¬≤C data                                                                     |
| **OLED SCL**   | **GPIO22** | I¬≤C clock                                                                    |
| **Button**     | **GPIO33** | Button to **GND**, uses internal pull-up                                     |
| **Buzzer I/O** | **GPIO25** | 3-pin buzzer‚Äôs signal pin                                                    |
| **LED1**       | **GPIO16** | Through 220 Œ© to LED anode                                                   |
| **LED2**       | **GPIO17** | Through 220 Œ© to LED anode                                                   |
| **LED3**       | **GPIO18** | Through 220 Œ© to LED anode                                                   |
| **3.3 V**      | ‚Äî          | OLED VCC, buzzer VCC (if 3.3 V), LED anodes via resistors (or use GPIO side) |
| **GND**        | ‚Äî          | Common ground for all devices                                                |

> OLED address defaults to **0x3C**; code falls back to **0x3D** if needed.

### Button (single)

* One leg to **GPIO33**
* Other leg to **GND**
* No external resistor needed (uses `INPUT_PULLUP`)

### LEDs (x3)

Typical wiring (active-HIGH):
`GPIOx ‚Üí 220Œ© ‚Üí LED anode, LED cathode ‚Üí GND`

### Buzzer (active module, 3-pin)

* **VCC** ‚Üí **3.3 V**
* **I/O** ‚Üí **GPIO25**
* **GND** ‚Üí **GND**

**Polarity note:** This sketch assumes **active-LOW** buzzer boards (LOW = sound ON).
If your buzzer is **active-HIGH** (HIGH = ON), change this line in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#define BUZZER_ACTIVE_LOW 1   // change to 0 for active-HIGH buzzers
```

## üóÇ Project Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ main.cpp      // full game logic (color & dice modes)

### Suggested `platformio.ini`

```ini
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32@6.12.0
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
upload_speed = 921600

lib_deps =
  adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library @ ^1.12.3
  adafruit/Adafruit SH110X @ ^2.1.14
  tzapu/WiFiManager @ ^2.0.17

; If you previously used src_filter, replace with:
; build_src_filter = +<src/>
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Build & Upload (PlatformIO)

1. **Clone** this repo or copy files into a new PlatformIO project.
2. Ensure **USB serial** is selected for your ESP32 board.
3. Click **Build** then **Upload** in your IDE (VS Code + PlatformIO), or run:

   ```
   pio run -t upload
   ```
4. Open **Serial Monitor** at **115200** baud:

   ```
   pio device monitor -b 115200
   ```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Boot**: You‚Äôll see a start screen (dice art + title).
2. **Short press** ‚Üí **Mode Select** screen (`> COLOR` / `> DICE`), caret switches every **2s**.
3. **Short press** to choose the highlighted mode.
4. **Play screen**:

   * **Short press**: Start rolling (colors/dice animate).
   * **Short press again**: Stop immediately and show the **CONGRATULATIONS** overlay with the final result layout (boxes/dice in black on white).
   * **Do nothing**: After **7 seconds**, it **auto-stops** and shows the same overlay + celebration.
5. **Long press (‚â•3s)** at any time after startup ‚Üí back to **Mode Select**.

---

## üß© Customization

* **Change pins**: edit the `#define` pin numbers at the top of `main.cpp`.
* **Buzzer behavior**: set `BUZZER_ACTIVE_LOW` to `0` if your module is active-HIGH.
* **Speeds**: tweak animation pacing and auto-lock time (`AUTO_LOCK_MS = 7000`).
* **OLED address**: defaults to `0x3C`, automatic fallback to `0x3D`. Modify in `setup()` if needed.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

* **Buzzer is constantly ON**
  Your module might be **active-HIGH**. Set:

  ```cpp
  #define BUZZER_ACTIVE_LOW 0
  ```

  Also confirm the buzzer **I/O** is on **GPIO25**, and VCC/GND are correct.

* **OLED shows nothing / scrambled**

  * Confirm **SDA=GPIO21**, **SCL=GPIO22**, and **3.3 V/GND**.
  * Many ‚Äú0.96in‚Äù displays are actually **SH1106**, not SSD1306. Ensure the library is **Adafruit SH110X** and you create `Adafruit_SH1106G`.
  * Try the fallback address **0x3D** (code already tries both).

* **LEDs don‚Äôt blink**

  * Check 220 Œ© resistors and orientation; try swapping anode/cathode wiring.
  * Verify pins 16/17/18 aren‚Äôt used by other peripherals in your setup.

* **Button doesn‚Äôt respond**

  * Confirm one leg is on **GPIO33** and the other is on **GND**.
  * Pin mode is `INPUT_PULLUP` (internal pull-up), so idle reads **HIGH**, pressed reads **LOW**.

## üì∏ Screens / Layout (textual)

* **Header**:
  `COLOR - *|*|*` or `DICE - *|*|*` (updated after each round, e.g., `R|B|G` or `3|5|1`)

* **Color Mode** (during rolling):

  ```
  [  RED  ] [ GREEN ]
      [  BLUE  ]
  ```

* **Dice Mode** (during rolling):
  Three dice only (no boxes); the **‚Äú6‚Äù** shows **three columns √ó two rows** of pips.

* **Win Overlay** (both modes):
  Full white background, **CONGRATULATIONS!** at the top, and the final result rendered exactly like the live view (boxes + labels for Color; black dice for Dice).
